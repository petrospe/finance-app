🔁 Multitenancy Requirements Recap
✅ Each tenant (company/account) has its own DB
✅ Each tenant is accessed via a subdomain (account1.localhost)
✅ Authentication, finances, and data are isolated
✅ Central admin/portal can create/manage accounts


✅ Updated Goals
Track all income & expense activity daily
Calculate real-time operational cost for the day
Compare today's expenses to income & budget
Forecast financial health (e.g., end-of-month balance)
Warn about overspending or low cashflow
Display "safe to spend" amount

🗂 1. Data Models
incomes
id | date | amount | category | description | source
expenses
id | date | amount | category | description | type (fixed/variable) | recurring | approved
budgets (optional but useful)
id | period (month/year) | expected_income | expected_expense
daily_summaries (for caching or reports)
id | date | total_income | total_expense | net_balance | operational_cost

📊 2. Core Calculations
✅ Today’s Operational Cost
$todayExpenses = Expense::whereDate('date', today())->sum('amount');
✅ Today’s Income
$todayIncome = Income::whereDate('date', today())->sum('amount');
✅ Net Balance
$net = $todayIncome - $todayExpenses;
✅ "Safe to Spend" (Optional)
If you define a monthly budget, calculate daily allowance:
$dailyBudget = ($monthlyBudget - sum(expensesToDate)) / remainingDays;

📈 3. Dashboards & Warnings
Metric	Description
Today’s Cost	Total spent today
Today’s Income	Money received today
Net Balance	Income – Expenses
Remaining Budget	Monthly budget – Spent so far
Safe to Spend Today	Based on pacing the budget evenly
Warning Alerts	If today’s expense > income or limit

🔁 4. Recurring Costs Handling
Support monthly/daily recurring expenses (e.g., rent, salaries, subscriptions). These should 
Added automatically per 
Flagged as fixed vs varia
Used in future forecast

💼 5. For Management Use
Give managers tools to:
Approve expenses
Set spending limits
Forecast cashflow
Simulate "what if" scenarios

do you know some if some of these have connectivity with greek tax authority to take data or send data?

Yes — in Greece, the **Independent Authority for Public Revenue (AADE)** has introduced the **myDATA** (My Digital Accounting and Tax Application) platform, which is **mandatory for businesses to digitally transmit their income and expense data**. Some software tools — including foreign or Greek ones — offer integration with **AADE myDATA**.

Here’s what you need to know:

---

## 🛠️ What If You’re Building Your Own?

If you want your **Laravel + Vue** application to send data to **myDATA**, here’s what to consider:

### 1. **AADE myDATA REST API**

* Documentation: [https://www.aade.gr/mydata](https://www.aade.gr/mydata)
* You'll need:

  * ✅ **Production or test API credentials**
  * ✅ Your **mark** (for income) and **uid** (for expenses)
  * ✅ XML or JSON payload formats
  * ✅ Authentication via client cert / OAuth2

### 2. **Register as Certified Software (if necessary)**

* Only certified platforms can directly push invoices (though workarounds exist via third parties)

### 3. **Use an Integration Partner**

* You could build via an **intermediary API service** like:

  * **Sleed myDATA Connector**
  * **AADE API Gateway from accounting platforms**

---

Would you like a working **Laravel service class example** that pushes income/expense to AADE’s myDATA sandbox (demo) API?

All the former web application provide day costs etc or are erp programs?

Great question — here's a breakdown:

Most of the **web applications mentioned earlier** (like QuickBooks, Xero, Epsilon Net, SoftOne, etc.) are **not strictly daily cost trackers**. Instead, they fall into one of two categories:

---

## 🧩 1. **ERP & Accounting Platforms (Broader Scope)**

These are **ERP-like or full accounting systems**, which include expenses/incomes as **part of a bigger feature set** (invoicing, inventory, payroll, etc.).

| Application             | Type                 | Daily Operational Cost Breakdown? | Comments                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epsilon Smart**       | ERP/accounting       | ❌ Limited                         | Focuses on invoicing, tax compliance (myDATA), not real-time cost analysis |
| **SoftOne / Prosvasis** | ERP                  | ❌ Not directly                    | You get reports, but not daily cash flow targeting decision-making         |
| **Elorus**              | Invoicing/accounting | ❌ Basic                           | Daily numbers via dashboards, but more focused on invoices/profits         |
| **QuickBooks**          | Accounting           | ✅ Limited Cash Flow Tracking      | Shows cash balances & trends but not per-day "safe-to-spend"               |
| **Xero**                | Cloud Accounting     | ✅ Cash Flow Forecasting           | Better graphs, but business-focused, not cost-centered                     |
| **Wave**                | Free Accounting      | ❌ Basic                           | No focus on day-specific operational cost control                          |

---

## 🎯 2. **Expense Trackers / Reporting Tools**

These focus on **logging costs and receipts**, not always accounting-grade.

| Application    | Type               | Daily Operational Cost Tracking? | Comments                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expensify**  | Expense reports    | ❌ No day-by-day breakdown        | Focus is per-employee, receipt management                 |
| **Fyle**       | Expense automation | ❌ Workflow-focused               | Helps control expense policies, not real-time cost status |
| **Manager.io** | Lightweight ERP    | ❌ Not built for daily review     | Good ledger-level visibility, manual setup needed         |

---

## ✅ Summary

* ❌ **Most systems don’t show daily operational cost (e.g., “How much money can I safely spend today?”).**
* ✅ That **gap** is your **main opportunity** — your app **can provide real-time, day-by-day financial clarity**, not just accounting.

---

## 🧠 Your App Could Offer:

* **Today’s starting cash**
* **Today’s expected income**
* **Today’s fixed expenses (salaries, rents)**
* **Discretionary expenses allowed (safe-to-spend amount)**
* **Red/yellow/green cost indicators**
* **Suggestions: delay this expense, too many payments today, etc.**

---

If you'd like, I can mock up an example of how this could look in a Vue dashboard — or suggest a data model to support it.


10. 🧮 (Optional) Add AADE myDATA Integration Later
Use Guzzle to POST expense/income data to https://mydata-dev.aade.gr, once accounts are active.
